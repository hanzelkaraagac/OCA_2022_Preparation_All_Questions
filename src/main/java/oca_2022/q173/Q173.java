Bus and Boat are Vehicle type classes.
The start() and stop() methods perform common operations across the Vehicle class type. The ride() method performs a unique operations for each type of Vehicle. 
Which set of actions meets the requirements with optimized code?
A. * 1. Create an abstract class Vehicle by defining start() and stop() methods, and declaring the ride() abstract method.
* 2. Create Bus and Boat classes by inheriting the Vehicle class and overriding the ride() method.
B. * 1. Create an interface Vehicle by defining start() and stop() methods, and declaring the ride() abstract method.
* 2. Create Bus and Boat classes by implementing the Vehicle class.
C. * 1. Create an abstract class Vehicle by declaring stop(), start(), and ride() abstract methods.
* 2. Create Bus and Boat classes by inheriting the Vehicle class and overriding all the methods.
D. * 1. Create an interface Vehicle by defining default stop(), start(), and ride() methods.
* 2. Create Bus and Boat classes by implementing the Vehicle interface and overriding the ride() method. Answer: A (I Think)
